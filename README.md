# Typescript module template

A typescript boilerplate to publish modules to npm

## Usage

Clone this repo, and start adding your code in the `index.ts` file.  
When you are done, write the tests in the `index.test.ts` file. For testing, this repo works with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

Once you finished, you can publish your module to npm with `npm publish`. This will compile your Typescript code
and send it to npm.

Make sure to change the name of the package in `package.json`

## Features
* Testing with Jest
* Linting out of the box (checks the style of your code), with TSLint
* Build, prepublish and other scripts to help you to develop
* Works with Typescript: Static typing for your JS Applications, reducing amount of runtime errors
* Coverage out of the box, thanks to Jest
* Uses deterministic module resolving, with Yarn
